/**
 * Represents a dataset that is split into partitions that can be uniquely addressed
 * by time. Each partition is a path in a file set, with a timestamp attached as meta data.
 * The timestamp is mapped to a partition key of a {@link co.cask.cdap.api.dataset.lib.PartitionedFileSet}
 * with five integer partitioning fields: the year, month, day, hour and minute. Partitions can
 * be retrieved using time range or using a {@link co.cask.cdap.api.dataset.lib.PartitionFilter}.
 * <p>
 * The granularity of time is in minutes, that is, any seconds or milliseconds after the
 * full minute is ignored for the partition keys. That means, there can not be be two partitions
 * in the same minute. Also, when retrieving partitions via time or time range using
 * {@link #getPartitionByTime}, {@link #getPartitionsByTime}, or when writing a partition using
 * {@link #getPartitionOutput}, the seconds and milliseconds on the
 * time or time range are ignored.
 * <p>
 * This dataset can be made available for querying with SQL (explore). This is enabled through dataset
 * properties when the dataset is created. See {@link co.cask.cdap.api.dataset.lib.FileSetProperties}
 * for details. If it is enabled for explore, a Hive external table will be created when the dataset is
 * created. The Hive table is partitioned by year, month, day, hour and minute.
