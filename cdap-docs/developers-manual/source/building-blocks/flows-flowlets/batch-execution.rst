===============
Batch Execution
===============

By default, a flowlet processes a single data object at a time within a single
transaction. To increase throughput, you can also process a batch of data objects within
the same transaction::

  @Batch(100)
  @ProcessInput
  public void process(String words) {
    ...

For the above batch example, the **process** method will be called up to 100 times per
transaction, with different data objects read from the input each time it is called.

If you are interested in knowing when a batch begins and ends, you can use an **Iterator**
as the method argument::

  @Batch(100)
  @ProcessInput
  public void process(Iterator<String> words) {
    ...

In this case, the **process** will be called once per transaction and the **Iterator**
will contain up to 100 data objects read from the input.
