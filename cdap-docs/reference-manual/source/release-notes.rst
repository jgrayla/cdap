Improvement
-----------

- The :ref:`metrics system APIs<http-restful-api-metrics>` have been revised and improved
  (`CDAP-1596 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1596>`__).
- The metrics system performance has been improved
  (`CDAP-2124 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-2124>`__, 
  `CDAP-2125 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-2125>`__).

Bug Fixes
---------

- The CDAP Authentication server now reports the port correctly when the port is set to 0
  (`CDAP-614 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-614>`__).

- History of the programs running under workflow (Spark and MapReduce) is now updated correctly
  (`CDAP-1293 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1293>`__).

- Programs running under a workflow now receive a unique ``run-id``
  (`CDAP-2025 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-2025>`__).

- RunRecords are now updated with the RuntimeService to account for node failures
  (`CDAP-2202 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-2202>`__).

- MapReduce metrics are now available on a secure cluster
  (`CDAP-64 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-64>`__).

API Changes
-----------

- The endpoint (``POST '<base-url>/metrics/search?target=childContext[&context=<context>]'``)
  that searched for the available contexts of metrics has been deprecated, pending removal
  in a later version of CDAP (`CDAP-1998 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1998>`__). A
  :ref:`replacement endpoint <http-restful-api-metrics-search-for-contexts>` is available.

- The endpoint (``POST '<base-url>/metrics/search?target=metric&context=<context>'``)
  that searched for metrics in a specified context has been deprecated, pending removal
  in a later version of CDAP (`CDAP-1998 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1998>`__). A
  :ref:`replacement endpoint <http-restful-api-metrics-search-for-metrics>` is available.

- The endpoint (``POST '<base-url>/metrics/query?context=<context>[&groupBy=<tags>]&metric=<metric>&<time-range>'``)
  that queried for a metric has been deprecated, pending removal
  in a later version of CDAP (`CDAP-1998 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1998>`__). A
  :ref:`replacement endpoint <http-restful-api-metrics-querying-a-metric>` is available.
  
- Metrics: The tag name for service handlers in previous releases was wrongly ``"runnable"``,
  and internally represented as ``"srn"``. These metrics are now tagged as ``"handler"`` (``"hnd"``), and
  metrics queries will only account for this tag name. If you need to query historic metrics
  that were emitted with the old tag ``"runnable"``, use ``"srn"`` to query them (instead of either
  ``"runnable"`` or ``"handler"``).

- The :ref:`CDAP CLI <cli>` startup options have been changed to accommodate a new option
  of executing a file containing a series of CLI commands, line-by-line.

- The metrics system APIs have been improved (`CDAP-1596 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1596>`__).

- The rules for :ref:`resolving resolution <http-restful-api-metrics-time-range>`
  when using ``resolution=auto`` in metrics query have been changed
  (`CDAP-1922 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1922>`__).

- Backward incompatible changes in ``InputFormatProvider`` and ``OutputFormatProvider``. 
  It won't affect user code that uses ``FileSet`` or ``PartitionedFileSet``. 
  It only affects classes who implement the ``InputFormatProvider`` or ``OutputFormatProvider``:

  - ``InputFormatProvider.getInputFormatClass()`` is removed and
  
    - replaced with ``InputFormatProvider.getInputFormatClassName()``;
    
  - ``OutputFormatProvider.getOutputFormatClass()`` is removed and
  
    - replaced with ``OutputFormatProvider.getOutputFormatClassName()``.


Deprecated and Removed Features
-------------------------------

- The `File DropZone <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/developers-manual/ingesting-tools/cdap-file-drop-zone.html>`__ 
  and `File Tailer <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/developers-manual/ingesting-tools/cdap-file-tailer.html>`__
  are no longer supported as of Release 3.0.
- Support for *procedures* has been removed. After upgrading, an application that
  contained a procedure must be redeployed. 
- Support for *service workers* have been removed. After upgrading, an application that
  contained a service worker must be redeployed.  
- The old CDAP Console has been deprecated.
- Support for JDK/JRE 1.6 (Java 6) has ended; JDK/JRE 1.7 (Java 7) is 
  :ref:`now required for CDAP <install-java-runtime>` or the

Known Issues
------------

- CDAP has been tested on and supports CDH 4.2.x through CDH 5.3.x, HDP 2.0 through 2.1, and
  Apache Bigtop 0.8.0. It has not been tested on more recent versions of CDH. 
  See :ref:`our Hadoop/HBase Environment configurations <install-hadoop-hbase>`.
  
- After upgrading CDAP from a pre-3.0 version, any unprocessed metrics data in Kafka will
  be lost and *WARN* log messages will be logged that tell about the inability to process
  old data in the old format.

- See the above section (*API Changes*) for alterations that can affect existing installations.

    please reach out to us at `cdap-user@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user>`__.
  - Added a metric migration tool which migrates old metrics to the new 2.8 format.


Improvement
-----------

- Improved flow performance and scalability with a new distributed queue implementation.


API Changes
-----------

- The endpoint (``GET <base-url>/data/explore/datasets/<dataset-name>/schema``) that
  retrieved the schema of a dataset's underlying Hive table has been removed
  (`CDAP-1603 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1603>`__).
- Endpoints have been added to retrieve the CDAP version and the current configurations of
  CDAP and HBase (:ref:`Configuration HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-configuration>`).


.. _known-issues-280:

Known Issues
------------

- See also the *Known Issues* of `version 2.7.1 <#known-issues-271>`_\ .
- If the Hive Metastore is restarted while the CDAP Explore Service is running, the 
  Explore Service remains alive, but becomes unusable. To correct, :ref:`restart the CDAP Master
  <install-starting-services>`, which will restart all services 
  (`CDAP-1007 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1007>`__).
- User datasets with names starting with ``"system"`` can potentially cause conflicts
  (`CDAP-1587 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1587>`__).
- Scaling the number of metrics processor instances doesn't automatically distribute the
  processing load to the newer instances of the metrics processor. The CDAP Master needs to be
  restarted to effectively distribute the processing across all metrics processor instances
  (`CDAP-1853 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1853>`__).
- Creating a dataset in a non-existent namespace manifests in the RESTful API with an
  incorrect error message (`CDAP-1864 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1864>`__).
- Retrieving multiple metrics |---| by issuing an HTTP POST request with a JSON list as
  the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metric |---| is currently not
  supported in the 
  `Metrics HTTP RESTful API v3 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/http-restful-api-v3/metrics.html#query-tips>`__.
  Instead, use the v2 API. It will be supported in a future release.
- Typically, datasets are bundled as part of applications. When an application is upgraded and redeployed,
  any changes in datasets will not be redeployed. This is because datasets can be shared across applications,
  and an incompatible schema change can break other applications that are using the dataset.
  A workaround (`CDAP-1253 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1253>`__) is to allow *unchecked dataset upgrades*.
  Upgrades cause the dataset metadata, i.e. its specification including properties, to be updated. The dataset
  runtime code is also updated. To prevent data loss the existing data and the underlying HBase tables remain as-is.

  You can allow *unchecked dataset upgrades* by setting the configuration property ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``
  to ``true`` in ``cdap-site.xml``. This will ensure that datasets are upgraded when the application is redeployed.
  When this configuration is set, the recommended process to deploy an upgraded dataset is to first stop
  all applications that are using the dataset before deploying the new version of the application.
  This lets all containers (flows, services, etc) to pick up the new dataset changes.
  When datasets are upgraded using ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``, no schema compatibility checks are performed by the
  system. Hence it is very important that the developer verify the backward-compatibility, and makes sure that
  other applications that are using the dataset can work with the new changes.


`Release 2.7.1 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.7.1/index.html>`__
=============================================================

API Changes
-----------
-  The property ``security.auth.server.address`` has been deprecated and replaced with
   ``security.auth.server.bind.address`` (`CDAP-639 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-639>`__,
   `CDAP-1078 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1078>`__).

New Features
------------

- **Spark**

  - Spark now uses a configurer-style API for specifying (`CDAP-382 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-382>`__).
  - Spark can now run as a part of a workflow (`CDAP-465 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-465>`__).

- **Security**

  - CDAP Master now obtains and refreshes Kerberos tickets programmatically (`CDAP-1134 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1134>`__).

- **Datasets**

  - A new, experimental dataset type to support time-partitioned File sets has been added.
  - Time-partitioned File sets can be queried with Impala on CDH distributions (`CDAP-926 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-926>`__).
  - Streams can be made queryable with Impala by deploying an adapter that periodically
    converts it into partitions of a time-partitioned File set (`CDAP-1129 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1129>`__).
  - Support for different levels of conflict detection: ``ROW``, ``COLUMN``, or ``NONE`` (`CDAP-1016 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1016>`__).
  - Removed support for ``@DisableTransaction`` (`CDAP-1279 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1279>`__).
  - Support for annotating a stream with a schema (`CDAP-606 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-606>`__).
  - A new API for uploading entire files to a stream has been added (`CDAP-411 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-411>`__).

- **Workflow**

  - Workflow now uses a configurer-style API for specifying (`CDAP-1207 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1207>`__).
  - Multiple instances of a workflow can be run concurrently (`CDAP-513 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-513>`__).
  - Programs are no longer part of a workflow; instead, they are added in the application
    and are referenced by a workflow using their names (`CDAP-1116 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1116>`__).
  - Schedules are now at the application level and properties can be specified for
    Schedules; these properties will be passed to the scheduled program as runtime
    arguments (`CDAP-1148 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1148>`__).

.. _known-issues-271:

  (`CDAP-383 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-383>`__).
- Fixed a problem with applications, whose Spark or Scala user classes were not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram``, failing with a class loading error
  (`CDAP-599 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-599>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the :ref:`CDAP upgrade tool <install-upgrade>` not preserving |---| for 
  tables with readless increments enabled |---| the coprocessor configuration during an upgrade
  (`CDAP-1044 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1044>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the readless increment implementation dropping increment cells when

Known Issues
------------

- When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available (`CDAP-64 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-64>`__ and `CDAP-797
  <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-797>`__).
- When upgrading a cluster from an earlier version of CDAP, warning messages may appear in
  the master log indicating that in-transit (emitted, but not yet processed) metrics
  system messages could not be decoded (*Failed to decode message to MetricsRecord*). This
  is because of a change in the format of emitted metrics, and can result in a small
  amount of metrics data points being lost (`CDAP-745
  <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-745>`__).
- Writing to datasets through Hive is not supported in CDH4.x
  (`CDAP-988 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-988>`__).
- A race condition resulting in a deadlock can occur when a TwillRunnable container
  shutdowns while it still has Zookeeper events to process. This occasionally surfaces when
  running with OpenJDK or JDK7, though not with Oracle JDK6. It is caused by a change in the
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` implementation between Oracle JDK6 and OpenJDK/JDK7. Until Twill is
  updated in a future version of CDAP, a work-around is to kill the errant process. The Yarn
  command to list all running applications and their ``app-id``\s is::
  
    yarn application -list -appStates RUNNING

  The command to kill a process is::
  
    yarn application -kill <app-id>
    
  All versions of CDAP running Twill version 0.4.0 with this configuration can exhibit this
  problem (`TWILL-110 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TWILL-110>`__).


`Release 2.5.2 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.5.2/index.html>`__
=============================================================

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed a problem with a Coopr-provisioned secure cluster failing to start due to a classpath
  issue (`CDAP-478 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-478>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the WISE app zip distribution not packaged correctly; a new version
  (0.2.1) has been released (`CDAP-533 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-533>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the examples and tests incorrectly using the ByteBuffer.array
  method when reading a stream event (`CDAP-549 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-549>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the Authentication Server so that it can now communicate with an LDAP
  instance over SSL (`CDAP-556 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-556>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the program class loader to allow applications to use a different
  version of a library than the one that the CDAP platform uses; for example, a different
  Kafka library (`CDAP-559 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-559>`__).
- Fixed a problem with CDAP master not obtaining new delegation tokens after running for 
  ``hbase.auth.key.update.interval`` milliseconds (`CDAP-562 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-562>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the transaction not being rolled back when a user service handler throws an exception 
  (`CDAP-607 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-607>`__).

Other Changes
-------------

- Improved the CDAP documentation:

  - Re-organized the documentation into three manuals |---| Developers' Manual, Administration
    Manual, Reference Manual |---| and a set of examples, how-to guides and tutorials;
  - Documents are now in smaller chapters, with numerous updates and revisions;
  - Added a link for downloading an archive of the documentation for offline use;
  - Added links to examples relevant to a particular component;
  - Added suggested deployment architectures for Distributed CDAP installations;
  - Added a glossary;
  - Added navigation aids at the bottom of each page; and
  - Tested and updated the Standalone CDAP examples and their documentation.

Known Issues
------------
- Currently, applications that include Spark or Scala classes in user classes not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram`` (depending upon the language)
  fail with a class loading error. Spark or Scala classes should not be used outside of the
  Spark program. (`CDAP-599 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-599>`__)

`Release 2.5.1 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.5.1/index.html>`__
=============================================================

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Improved the documentation of the CDAP authentication and stream clients, both Java and Python APIs.
- Fixed problems with the CDAP Command Line Interface (CLI):

  - Did not work in non-interactive mode;
  - Printed excessive debug log messages;
  - Relative paths did not work as expected; and 
  - Failed to execute SQL queries.
  
- Removed dependencies on SNAPSHOT artifacts for *netty-http* and *auth-clients*. 
- Corrected an error in the message printed by the startup script ``cdap.sh``.
- Resolved a problem with the reading of the properties file by the CDAP Flume Client of CDAP Ingest library
  without first checking if authentication was enabled.

Other Changes
-------------

- The scripts ``send-query.sh``, ``access-token.sh`` and ``access-token.bat`` has been replaced by the 
  :ref:`CDAP Command Line Interface, <cli>` ``cdap-cli.sh``.
- The CDAP Command Line Interface now uses and saves access tokens when connecting to a secure CDAP instance.
- The CDAP Java Stream Client now allows empty String events to be sent.
- The CDAP Python Authentication Client's ``configure()`` method now takes a dictionary rather than a filepath.
