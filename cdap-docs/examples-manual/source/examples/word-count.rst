==========
Word Count
==========

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) example demonstrating flows, datasets and services.

Overview
========

This application receives words and sentences from a stream and uses flowlets in a flow to
process the sentences and store the results and statistics in datasets.

- The ``wordStream`` receives sentences, one event at a time.
- The ``splitter`` flowlet reads sentences from stream and splits them into words, writes 
  global statistics of the received words such as "total words received" and "total length
  of words received" and emits each word to the ``counter`` flowlet  and each sentence
  (list of words) to the ``associator`` flowlet.
- The ``associator`` flowlet receives the set of words and writes word associations to the 
  ``wordAssocs`` dataset. For example, if we receive a sentence ``"Welcome to CDAP"``, the
  word associations are ``{"Welcome", "to"}`` , ``{"Welcome", "CDAP"}``, and ``{"to",
  "CDAP"}``.
- The ``counter`` flowlet receives a word, increments the count for the word |---| 
  maintained in a key-value table |---| and forwards the word to the ``unique`` flowlet.
- The ``unique`` flowlet receives a word and updates the ``uniqueCount`` table, if it is 
  seeing this word for the first time.

Let's look at some of these components, and then run the application and see the results.

The Word Count Application
--------------------------

As in the other :ref:`examples <examples-index>`, the components
of the application are tied together by the class ``WordCount``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/WordCount/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/wordcount/WordCount.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 27-

Data Storage
------------

- ``wordStats`` stores the global statistics of total count of words and the total length of words received.
- ``wordCounts`` stores the word and the corresponding count in a key value table.
- ``uniqueCount`` is a custom dataset that stores the total count of unique words received so far.
- ``wordAssocs`` is a custom dataset that stores the count for word associations.

.. _word-count-service-requests:

RetrieveCounts Service
----------------------

The service serves read requests for calculated statistics, word counts and associations.
It exposes these endpoints:

- ``/stats`` returns the total number of words, the number of unique words, and the average word length;
- ``/count/{word}`` returns the word count of a specified word and its word associations,
  up to the specified limit or a pre-set limit of ten if not specified;
- ``/assoc/{word1}/{word2}`` returns the top associated words (those with the highest counts).


Building and Starting
=====================

.. include:: building-and-starting.txt


Running CDAP Applications
=========================

.. |example| replace:: WordCount

.. include:: /../../developers-manual/source/getting-started/building-apps.rst
   :start-line: 11


Running the Example
===================

Starting the Flow
-----------------

Once the application is deployed:

- Go to the *WordCount* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/WordCount/overview/status>`__,
  click ``WordCounter`` to get to the flow detail page, then click the *Start* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh start flow WordCount.WordCounter
  
    Successfully started flow 'WordCounter' of application 'WordCount' with stored runtime arguments '{}'

Starting the Service
--------------------

Once the application is deployed:

- Go to the *WordCount* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/WordCount/overview/status>`__,
  click ``RetrieveCounts`` to get to the service detail page, then click the *Start* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh start service WordCount.RetrieveCounts
    
    Successfully started service 'RetrieveCounts' of application 'WordCount' with stored runtime arguments '{}'

Injecting Sentences
-------------------

In the application's `detail page
<http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/WordCount/overview/status>`__, click on the
*WordCounter* flow. This takes you to the flow details page. 

Now click on the *wordStream* stream on the left side of the flow visualization, which
brings up a pop-up window. Enter a sentence such as "Hello CDAP" and click on the *Inject*
button. 

After you close the pop-up window (using the button in the window's upper-right), you will
see that the counter for the stream increases to 1, the counters for the flowlets
*splitter* and *associator* increase to 1 and the counters for the flowlets *counter* and
*unique* increase to 2. You can repeat this step to enter additional sentences.

Querying the Results
--------------------

.. highlight:: console

To query the ``RetrieveCounts`` service, either:

- Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

    $ curl -w'\n' 'http://localhost:10000/v3/namespaces/default/apps/WordCount/services/RetrieveCounts/methods/count/CDAP'

- Use the CDAP CLI::

    $ cdap-cli.sh call service WordCount.RetrieveCounts GET /count/CDAP

The word count and top-10 associations words for that word will be displayed in JSON
format (example reformatted to fit; results will depend on what you have submitted)::

  {
    "assocs": {
      "Hello":1,
      "BigData":3,
      "Cask":5,
    },
    "count":6,
    "word":"CDAP"
  }

You can also make requests to the other endpoints available in this service, as 
:ref:`described above <word-count-service-requests>`.


Stopping and Removing the Application
=====================================
Once done, you can stop the application as described above in `Stopping an Application. 
<#stopping-an-application>`__ Here is an example-specific description of the steps:

**Stopping the Flow**

- Go to the *WordCount* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/WordCount/overview/status>`__,
  click ``WordCounter`` to get to the flow detail page, then click the *Stop* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh stop flow WordCount.WordCounter 

**Stopping the Service**

- Go to the *WordCount* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/WordCount/overview/status>`__,
  click ``RetrieveCounts`` to get to the flow detail page, then click the *Stop* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh stop service WordCount.RetrieveCounts 

**Removing the Application**

You can now remove the application as described above, `Removing an Application <#removing-an-application>`__, or:

- Go to the *WordCount* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/WordCount/overview/status>`__,
  click the *Actions* menu on the right side and select *Manage* to go to the Management pane for the application,
  then click the *Actions* menu on the right side and select *Delete* to delete the application; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh delete app WordCount
